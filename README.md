Shipshape
=========

Shipment tracking, simplified


Goal: a gem that will provide current shipment status and, whenever possible, expected delivery date across across as many carriers as possible - USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Ontrac, Canada Post, others.

The key nice feature will be to avoid having to identify the carrier prior to requesting status; this library will do so for you (or will ask multiple potential carriers if needed)

Current work in progress: USPS

Roadmap:

- UPS
- FedEx
- publish as gem
- Ontrac
- other carriers
